      This function helps create scatter plots with marginal histograms
      (we call this plot a scattergram) to help assess the threshold grid
      and fit of the TAPAS model.

      These functions apply the TAPAS model fit to new subjects to
      determine a subject-specific threshold and create segmentation masks.

      The data contained in this package contains 3D arrays for 15
      synthetic gold standard segmentations (`gs#`), 15 probability
      maps (`pmap#`), and a single brain mask (`brain_mask`) that
      can be used for all 30 images. The `#` value noted can be any
      number 1-15. Package data is set to `Lazy Data: true` and will
      therefore be automatically loaded with the package. We use 10
      subjects for training the TAPAS model and then evaluate the
      model using 5 subjects excluded from training in this tutorial.
      The gold standard segmentations and probability maps consist of
      a single slice with voxel values and a second slice where all
      voxels are equal to 0. The brain mask contains a brain mask
      value in both slices. These are saved as arrays which we will
      convert to `nifti` objects. The authors would like to re-iterate
      that all data available in the package and used throughout this
      vignette are synthetic and created by the authors simply for
      demonstration of the package usage. The data is meant to
      mimic a simple set of real data.
