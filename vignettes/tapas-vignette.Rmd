# Overview <img src="https://github.com/avalcarcel9/rtapas/blob/master/inst/sticker.png" width = "150" align="right" />

The `rtapas` package determines a subject-specific threshold to apply to multiple sclerosis lesion probability maps for automatic segmentation. This R package is based on the Thresholding Approach for Probability Map Automatic Segmentation (TAPAS) method. The methods are in progress for publication. This package creates the data structures necessary for training the TAPAS model. After training, the model can be used to predict subject-specific thresholds to use on probability maps for automatic lesion segmentation. Methods can be extended outside of multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation but have not been validated.

# Installation

To get the latest development version from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github('avalcarcel9/rtapas')
```

We are currently working to get the package on [Neuroconductor](www.neuroconductor.org).

# Function Documentation

The TAPAS package contains a number of functions to generate data required for training, train the model, and predict subject-specific thresholds based on the trained model. The functions, defaults, and usage are provided below.

## `tapas_data`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tapas_data(thresholds = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.01),
           pmap,
           gold_standard,
           mask,
           k = 0,
           subject_id = NULL,
           verbose = TRUE)
```

__Description__: 

This function creates the training vectors for a single subject from a probability map, a gold standard mask (normally a manual segmentation), and a brain mask. For a grid of thresholds provided and applied to the probability map the function calculates Sørensen's–Dice coefficient (DSC) between the automatic image and the gold standard image. The function also calculates the volume associated with thresholding at each respective threshold.

__Usage__:

- `thresholds` A `vector` of thresholds to apply to the probability map. The default
 `vector` applied is 0 to 1 by 0.01 increments. Threshold values must be between 0 and 1.
- `pmap` A `character` file path to a probability map image or an object of class `nifti`.
- `gold_standard` A `character` file path to a gold standard image (normally a manual segmentation) or an object of class `nifti`. The gold standard segmentation is used to compare the thresholded probability map image using Sørensen's–Dice coefficient (DSC).  
- `mask` A `character` file path to a brain mask image or an object of class `nifti`.  
- `k` The minimum number of voxels for a cluster/component. Passed to `extrantsr::label_mask`. Segmentation clusters of size less than k are removed from the mask, volume estimation, and the Sørensen's–Dice coefficient (DSC) calculation.
- `subject_id` A subject ID of class `character`. By default this is set to `NULL` but users must provide an ID.  
- `verbose` A `logical` argument to print messages. Set to `TRUE` by default.  

__Return__: 

A `tibble` containing the training data for a single subject. The data contains columns `threshold`, Sørensen's–Dice coefficient (`dsc`), and `volume`.

## `tapas_data_par`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tapas_data_par(cores = 1,
               thresholds = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.01),
               pmap,
               gold_standard,
               mask,
               k = 0,
               subject_id = NULL,
               ret = FALSE,
               outfile = NULL,
               verbose = TRUE)
```

__Description__: 

This function wraps `tapas_data` to run in parallel. This function creates the training vectors for all subjects from a probability map, a gold standard mask (normally a manual segmentation), and a brain mask. For a grid of thresholds provided and applied to the probability map the function calculates Sørensen's–Dice coefficient (DSC) between the automatic image and the gold standard image. The function also calculates the volume associated with thresholding at each respective threshold.

__Usage__:

- `cores` The number of cores to use. This argument controls at most how many child processes will be run simultaneously. The default is set to 1.  
- `thresholds` A `vector` of thresholds to apply to the probability maps. The default `vector` applied is 0 to 1 by 0.01 increments. Threshold values must be between 0 and 1.  
- `pmap` A `vector` of `character` file paths to probability map images or a `list` object with elements of class `nifti`.
- `gold_standard` A `vector` of `character` file paths to gold standard images (normally a manual segmentation) or a `list` object with elements of class `nifti`. The gold standard segmentation is used to compare the thresholded probability map image using Sørensen's–Dice coefficient (DSC).
- `mask` A `vector` of `character` file paths to brain mask images or a `list` object with elements of class `nifti`.  
- `k` The minimum number of voxels for a cluster/component. Passed to `extrantsr::label_mask`.
 Segmentation clusters of size less than k are removed from the mask, volume estimation, and the Sørensen's–Dice coefficient (DSC) calculation.  
- `subject_id` A `vector` of subject IDs of class `character`. By default this is set to `NULL` but users must provide an ID `vector`.
- `ret` A `logical` argument set to `TRUE` by default. Return the `tibble` objects from the function as a `list` in the local R environment. If `FALSE` then `outfile` must be specified so subject data is saved.
- `outfile` Is set to `NULL` by default which only returns the subject-level `tibble` as a list in the local R environment. To save each subject-level `tibble` as an R object specify a `vector` or `list` of file paths to save with either .rds or .RData extensions included.
- `verbose` A `logical` argument to print messages. Set to `TRUE` by default.  

__Return__: 

A `list` with the subject-level `tibble` object in each element returned from `tapas_data` for each subject. `ret` must be `TRUE` to return objects locally. To save objects a `vector` of `outfile` file paths must be provided.

## `tapas_train`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tapas_train(data, 
            dsc_cutoff = 0.03, 
            verbose = TRUE)
```

__Description__: 

This function trains the TAPAS model using all binded subject-level `tibble`s produced from the `tapas_data` function. The TAPAS model is fit and clamp data is calculated. The clamp data contains the predicted threshold when using the 10th and 90th percentile volume from training data.

__Usage__:

- `data` Data resulting from `tapas_data`. The `data` should be a `tibble` or `data.frame` containing binded subject data or a `list` object with subject data in each element. Data from these subjects will be used for model training.  
- `dsc_cutoff` The Sørensen's–Dice coefficient (DSC) value to use as a cutoff for training inclusion. By default 0.03 is used. This must be a single value between 0 and 1. Only training subjects with a subject-specific threshold estimate resulting in Sørensen's–Dice coefficient (DSC) greater than or equal to the `dsc_cutoff` will be included in training the TAPAS model.  
- `verbose` A `logical` argument to print messages. Set to `TRUE` by default.  

__Return__: 

A `list` with the TAPAS model (`tapas_model`) of class `gam` and the a `tibble` with the clamp information (`clamp_data`). The clamp information contains the TAPAS-predicted smallest and largest threshold to be applied by using estimates related to the volume at the 10th and 90th percentile.

## `tapas_predict`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tapas_predict(pmap, 
              model, 
              clamp = TRUE, 
              k = 0, 
              verbose = TRUE){
```

__Description__:

This function takes a probability map for a single subject and predicts the subject-specific threshold to apply based on the TAPAS model generated from `tapas_train`. The function will return a `list` of objects including the TAPAS predicted subject-specific threshold, the lesion mask produced from applying this threshold, and the lesion mask produced from using the group threshold.

__Usage__:

- `pmap` A `character` file path to a probability map image or an object of class `nifti`.
- `model` The TAPAS model fit from `tapas_train` of class `gam`. This model will be used to make subject-specific threshold predictions.
- `clamp` A `logical` object set to `TRUE` by default. This setting uses the clamped subject-specific threshold prediction rather than the prediction fit by the TAPAS `model`. This only applies to volumes exceeding those at the 10th and 90th percentile calculated using the training data. Using the clamp data avoids extrapolation when the naive volume estimate falls in the tails of the TAPAS model. If `FALSE` then the the TAPAS model predicted threshold will be used for segmentation rather than the clamped threshold. 
- `k` The minimum number of voxels for a cluster/component. Passed to `extrantsr::label_mask`. Segmentation clusters of size less than k are removed from the mask, volume estimation, and the Sørensen's–Dice coefficient (DSC) calculation.
- `verbose` A `logical` argument to print messages. Set to `TRUE` by default.

__Return__:

A `list` containing the TAPAS predicted subject-specific threshold (`subject_threshold`), the lesion segmentation mask obtained using the TAPAS predicted subject-specific threshold (`tapas_binary_mask`), and the lesion segmentation mask obtained using the group threshold (`group_binary_mask`).

## `tapas_predict_par`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tapas_predict_par(cores = 1,
                  pmap,
                  subject_id,
                  model,
                  clamp = TRUE,
                  k = 0,
                  ret = FALSE,
                  outfile = NULL,
                  verbose = TRUE)
```

__Description__:

This function wraps `tapas_predict` to run in parallel. This function takes probability maps across subjects and predicts the subject-specific threshold to apply based on the TAPAS model generated from `tapas_train`. The function will return or save a list of objects for each subject including the TAPAS predicted subject-specific threshold, the lesion mask produced from applying this threshold, as well as the lesion mask produced from using the group threshold.

__Usage__:

- `cores` The number of cores to use. This argument controls at most how many child processes will be run simultaneously. The default is set to 1.
- `pmap` A `vector` of `character` file paths to probability map images or a `list` object with elements of class `nifti`.
- `subject_id` A `vector` of subject IDs of class `character`. By default this is set to `NULL` but users must provide an ID.
- `model` The TAPAS model fit from `tapas_train` of class `gam`. This model will be used to make subject-specific threshold predictions.
- `clamp` A `logical` object set to `TRUE` by default. This setting uses the clamped subject-specific threshold prediction rather than the prediction fit by the TAPAS model. This only applies to volumes exceeding those at the 10th and 90th percentile calculated using the training data. Using the clamp data avoids extrapolation when the naive volume estimate falls in the tails of the TAPAS model. If `FALSE` then the the TAPAS `model` predicted threshold will be used for segmentation rather than the clamped threshold. 
- `k` The minimum number of voxels for a cluster/component. Passed to `extrantsr::label_mask`. Segmentation clusters of size less than k are removed from the mask, volume estimation, and the Sørensen's–Dice coefficient (DSC) calculation.
- `ret` A `logical` argument set to `TRUE` by default. Returns a nested `list` of objects from the function to the local R environment. If `FALSE` then `outfile` must be specified so subject data is saved.
- `outfile` Is set to `NULL` by default which only returns the subject-level `tibble` as a list in the local R environment. To save each subject-level `tibble` as an R object specify a `list` or `vector` of file paths to save with either .rds or .RData extensions included.
- `verbose` A `logical` argument to print messages. Set to `TRUE` by default.

__Return__:

A nested `list`. Each element in the list contains subject-level data returned from `tapas_predict`.

# Tutorial Data

TAPAS is a post-hoc approach to determine a subject-specific threshold for automatic segmentation of probability maps in the context of MS lesions. To apply TAPAS, users should first run an automatic segmentation method of choice to obtain probability maps. At this point, TAPAS can be applied in order to obtain subject-specific thresholds for segmentation. In the original TAPAS work we used MIMoSA ([1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jon.12506),[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158218303231)) as the automatic segmentation algorithm to generate probability maps which has software available on [Neuroconductor](https://neuroconductor.org/package/mimosa) and documentation on [GitHub](https://github.com/avalcarcel9/mimosa/blob/master/vignettes/mimosa_git.md). The data provided in this package and used throughout this vignette are synthetic. The package contains 15 3D "gold standard" masks that were created by Alessandra Valcarcel to appear similar to manually segmented lesion masks. The package also includes "probability maps" that were created by randomly generating uniform data for each subject inside of the "gold standard" masks and then smoothing the maps. Each map is generated using different end points so that the probability distribution is variable across subjects. The package also contains a single brain mask that applies to all synthetic gold standard and probability maps. The first slice is an empty slice while the second slice contains a the probability density and the gold standard manual segmentations. We use a single empty slice simply to make images 3D. Since these probability maps are generated randomly from a uniform distribution the spatial distribution of probability is quite different than real data. 

The authors would like to re-iterate that all data available in the package and used throughout this vignette are synthetic and created by the authors simply for demonstration of the package usage. The data is meant to mimic a simple set of real data.

The data contained in this package contains 3D arrays for 15 synthetic gold standard segmentations (`gs#`), 15 probability maps (`pmap#`), and a single brain mask (`brain_mask`) that can be used for all 30 images. The `#` value noted can be any number 1-15. Package data is set to `Lazy Data: true` and will therefore be automatically loaded with the package. We use 10 subjects for training the TAPAS model and then evaluate the model using 5 subjects excluded from training in this tutorial. The gold standard segmentations and probability maps consist of a single slice with voxel values and a second slice where all voxels are equal to 0. The brain mask contains a brain mask value in both slices. These are saved as arrays which we will convert to `nifti` objects.

# Load Training Data

To use the data throughout this tutorial we will initialize the 10 gold standard masks, 10 probability maps, and 10 brain masks into a list.

## Training Gold Standard Masks

The gold standard masks are all saved as `gs#`. We will use the first 10 to train the TAPAS model.

```{r}
# Make a list of the gold standard masks
train_gold_standard_masks = list(gs1 = gs1, 
                                 gs2 = gs2, 
                                 gs3 = gs3, 
                                 gs4 = gs4, 
                                 gs5 = gs5, 
                                 gs6 = gs6, 
                                 gs7 = gs7, 
                                 gs8 = gs8, 
                                 gs9 = gs9, 
                                 gs10 = gs10)

# Convert the gold standard masks to nifti objects
train_gold_standard_masks = lapply(train_gold_standard_masks, oro.nifti::nifti)
```

The gold standard segmentations are visualized below:

```{r}
# Show the gold standard masks using patchwork
oro.nifti::image(train_gold_standard_masks$gs1) + oro.nifti::image(train_gold_standard_masks$gs2) + 
oro.nifti::image(train_gold_standard_masks$gs3) + oro.nifti::image(train_gold_standard_masks$gs4) +
oro.nifti::image(train_gold_standard_masks$gs5) + oro.nifti::image(train_gold_standard_masks$gs6) +
oro.nifti::image(train_gold_standard_masks$gs7) + oro.nifti::image(train_gold_standard_masks$gs8) +
oro.nifti::image(train_gold_standard_masks$gs9) + oro.nifti::image(train_gold_standard_masks$gs10) 
```

## Training Probability Maps

The probability maps are all saved as `pmap#`. We will use the first 10 to train the TAPAS model.

```{r}
# Make a list of the training probability maps
train_probability_maps = list(pmap1 = pmap1, 
                              pmap2 = pmap2, 
                              pmap3 = pmap3, 
                              pmap4 = pmap4, 
                              pmap5 = pmap5, 
                              pmap6 = pmap6, 
                              pmap7 = pmap7, 
                              pmap8 = pmap8, 
                              pmap9 = pmap9, 
                              pmap10 = pmap10)

# Convert the probability maps to nifti objects
train_probability_maps = lapply(train_probability_maps, oro.nifti::nifti)
```

The probability maps are visualized below:

```{r}
# Show the probability maps using patchwork
oro.nifti::image(train_probability_maps$pmap1, col = heat.colors(100)) + 
  oro.nifti::image(train_probability_maps$pmap2, col = heat.colors(100)) + 
  oro.nifti::image(train_probability_maps$pmap3, col = heat.colors(100)) + 
  oro.nifti::image(train_probability_maps$pmap4, col = heat.colors(100)) +
  oro.nifti::image(train_probability_maps$pmap5, col = heat.colors(100)) + 
  oro.nifti::image(train_probability_maps$pmap6, col = heat.colors(100)) +
  oro.nifti::image(train_probability_maps$pmap7, col = heat.colors(100)) + 
  oro.nifti::image(train_probability_maps$pmap8, col = heat.colors(100)) +
  oro.nifti::image(train_probability_maps$pmap9, col = heat.colors(100)) +
  oro.nifti::image(train_probability_maps$pmap10, col = heat.colors(100)) 
```

## Training Brain Mask

There is only one brain mask included in the example data with this package. This mask was created manually just to cover all the "brain matter" in the gold standard masks and probability maps. Often each subject will have a unique brain mask depending on the registration technique. Below we create a list of brain masks so that the indices match the indices of the gold standard list and probability map list.

```{r}
# Make a list of the brain masks
train_brain_masks = list(brain_mask1 = brain_mask, 
                         brain_mask2 = brain_mask, 
                         brain_mask3 = brain_mask, 
                         brain_mask4 = brain_mask, 
                         brain_mask5 = brain_mask, 
                         brain_mask6 = brain_mask, 
                         brain_mask7 = brain_mask, 
                         brain_mask8 = brain_mask, 
                         brain_mask9 = brain_mask, 
                         brain_mask10 = brain_mask)

# Convert the brain masks to nifti objects
train_brain_masks = lapply(train_brain_masks, oro.nifti::nifti)
```

## Training Subject ID

We will also need a vector of subject IDs to include. We simply create an ID vector below:

```{r}
train_ids = paste0('subject_', 1:length(train_gold_standard_masks))
```

# Generating TAPAS Model Data

Before we can fit the TAPAS model, we have to generate the threshold data required for model input. The model requires the Sørensen–Dice coefficient value evaluated across all `thresholds` values for each subject in the training set. We suggest evaluating thresholds from 0 to 1 by 1% increments. This can be carried out using two functions: `tapas_data` and `tapas_data_par`. The `tapas_data` function will produce the model data for a single subject whereas `tapas_data_par` is a wrapper around `tapas_data` and will run in parallel for multiple subjects.

Below we will calculate the TAPAS model input data using the example data subject by subject using `tapas_data`. We implement a `for` loop for simplicity. The `pmap`,  `gold_standard`, and `mask` inputs must be either a local object of class `nifti` or a vector of file paths to a `nifti` object. The `subject_id` is simply a vector of subject IDs. These can be character or numeric. For this example we set `k = 0` since the data is only a single slice of segmented values and probability maps were randomly generated from a uniform. The `thresholds` and `verbose` inputs are all set to the default. 

```{r}
# Initialize an empty list to store results created on 1 core
train_data1 = list()

# Run tapas_data function
for(i in 1:length(train_probability_maps)){
  train_data1[[i]] = tapas_data(thresholds = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.01),
                         pmap = train_probability_maps[[i]],
                         gold_standard = train_gold_standard_masks[[i]],
                         mask = train_brain_masks[[i]],
                         k = 0,
                         subject_id = train_ids[[i]],
                         verbose = TRUE)
}
```

The `tapas_data_par` function simply is a parallel wrapper around `tapas_data`. Before we look at the return objects from these functions let's replicate the results from `tapas_data` using `tapas_data_par` with 2 cores. The `tapas_data_par` function is compatible with on both Unix and Windows machines. Again, the code below is going to run on 2 cores so be sure your machine has access to 2 cores or reduce back down to 1.

The inputs for `tapas_data_par` are similar to the `tapas_data` function but instead of single subject values we use either a `list` of `nifti` objects or a `vector` of file paths to `nifti` objects. By setting `ret = TRUE` the subject TAPAS data generated by the wrapped `tapas_data` function will be returned locally in as a `list`. This object may be extremely large depending on the number of subjects used for training so be aware of memory constraints if returning these objects locally. By default `outfile = NULL` and the subject-level TAPAS data generated will not be saved out. If users would like to save the subject-level data out then users must specify a vector of file paths with `.rda` or `.RData` file extensions included. Be sure that across `list` and `vector` inputs the subject-level information is sorted and consistent across each input.

```{r}
# Store results created on 2 cores
# Run tapas_data_par function
train_data2 = tapas_data_par(cores = 2, 
                             thresholds = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.01), 
                             pmap = train_probability_maps, 
                             gold_standard = train_gold_standard_masks, 
                             mask = train_brain_masks, 
                             k = 0, 
                             subject_id = train_ids,
                             ret = TRUE, 
                             outfile = NULL, 
                             verbose = TRUE)
```

The data produced using these functions is exactly the same. The only difference is whether users would like to utilize parallel computing.

```{r}
# Bind the single core data across list objects (subjects)
train_data1 = dplyr::bind_rows(train_data1)
# Bind the 2 core data across list objects (subjects)
train_data2 = dplyr::bind_rows(train_data2)
# Check that datasets are equal
all.equal(train_data1, train_data2)
```

The data returned from either of these functions is needed to train the TAPAS model. The `tapas_data` function returns a single subject level tibble while the `tapas_data_par` returns a list with each subject-level tibble as an element in the list (only if `ret = TRUE`). Each subject-level tibble contains the following columns: `threshold`, `dsc`, `volume`, and `subject_id`. The first and last 5 rows of `train_data1` are shown below:

```{r}
head(train_data1)
tail(train_data1)
```

# Fit the TAPAS Model

After the TAPAS data is generated using either `tapas_data` or `tapas_data_par` the TAPAS model can be fit using the `tapas_train` function. The subject training data must either be a binded `tibble` or `data.frame` or a list with each element the subject data. Previously, we binded the data together to compare `train_data1` and `train_data2` so we will use the `tibble` produced from above. We did this above when checking that `train_data1` and `train_data2` are equal. 

```{r}
tapas_model = tapas_train(data = train_data1, 
                          dsc_cutoff = 0.03, 
                          verbose = TRUE)
```

The return object from running `tapas_train` includes a list with the model in the named element `tapas_model`, the group threshold in the named element `group_threshold`, and the information about the clamping thresholds in the element `clamp_data`. Let's look at these objects:

```{r}
# The TAPAS GAM model
summary(tapas_model$tapas_model)
# The threshold that optimizes group-level DSC
tapas_model$group_threshold
# The lower and upper bound clamps to avoid extrapolation
tapas_model$clamp_data
```

We can use this model to predict a subject-specific thresholds, create a segmentation mask using this threshold, and create a segmentation mask using the group-threshold for a subjects not included in model training.

# Load Testing Data

To use the data throughout the testing of the model we will initialize the remaining 5 gold standard masks, 5 probability maps, and 5 brain masks not used in the training procedure into a list.

## Testing Gold Standard Masks

The gold standard masks are all saved as `gs#`. We will use the last 5 to train the TAPAS model.

```{r}
# Testing gold standard masks
test_gold_standard_masks = list(gs11 = gs11,
                                gs12 = gs12,
                                gs13 = gs13,
                                gs14 = gs14,
                                gs15 = gs15)

# Make array objects niftis
test_gold_standard_masks = lapply(test_gold_standard_masks, oro.nifti::nifti)

# Visualize the testing subjects gold standard masks
oro.nifti::image(test_gold_standard_masks$gs11) + oro.nifti::image(test_gold_standard_masks$gs12) +
oro.nifti::image(test_gold_standard_masks$gs13) + oro.nifti::image(test_gold_standard_masks$gs14) +
oro.nifti::image(test_gold_standard_masks$gs15)
```

The gold standard segmentations are visualized below:

## Testing Probability Maps

The probability maps are all saved as `pmap#`. We will use the last 5 to train the TAPAS model.

```{r}
# Obtain the test subject probability maps
test_probability_maps = list(pmap11 = pmap11, 
                             pmap12 = pmap12,
                             pmap13 = pmap13,
                             pmap14 = pmap14,
                             pmap15 = pmap15)

# Make array objects niftis
test_probability_maps = lapply(test_probability_maps, oro.nifti::nifti)

# Visualize the 5 testing probability maps
oro.nifti::image(test_probability_maps$pmap11, col = heat.colors(100)) +
oro.nifti::image(test_probability_maps$pmap12, col = heat.colors(100)) +
oro.nifti::image(test_probability_maps$pmap13, col = heat.colors(100)) +
oro.nifti::image(test_probability_maps$pmap14, col = heat.colors(100)) +
oro.nifti::image(test_probability_maps$pmap15, col = heat.colors(100))
```

The probability maps are visualized below:

## Testing Brain Masks

There is only one brain mask included in the example data with this package. This mask was created manually just to cover all the "brain matter" in the gold standard masks and probability maps. Often each subject will have a unique brain mask depending on the registration technique. Below we create a list of brain masks so that the indices match the indices of the gold standard list and probability map list.

```{r}
# Create a list of testing brain masks
test_brain_masks = list(brain_mask11 = brain_mask, 
                        brain_mask12 = brain_mask,
                        brain_mask13 = brain_mask,
                        brain_mask14 = brain_mask,
                        brain_mask15 = brain_mask)

# Make array objects niftis
test_brain_masks = lapply(test_brain_masks, oro.nifti::nifti)
```

## Testing Subject ID

We will also need a vector of subject IDs to include. We simply create an ID vector below:

```{r}
test_ids = paste0('subject_', (10 + 1:length(test_gold_standard_masks)))
```

# Predicting Thresholds and Segmentation Masks

Below we will predict using the TAPAS model subject by subject using `tapas_predict`. We implement a `for` loop for simplicity. The `pmap` and `mask` inputs must be either a local object of class `nifti` or a vector of file paths to a `nifti` object. The `subject_id` is simply a vector of subject IDs. These can be character or numeric. For this example we set `k = 0` since the data is only a single slice of segmented values and probability maps were randomly generated from a uniform. We use the default `clamp = TRUE` which will use the threshold associated with the 10th or 90th percentile volume from the training data rather than the subject-specific fitted value. This is to avoid extrapolation in the tails of the TAPAS model. The `verbose` input is set to `TRUE`. 

```{r}
# Initialize an empty list to store results created on 1 core
test_data1 = list()

# Run tapas_predict function
for(i in 1:length(test_probability_maps)){
  test_data1[[i]] = tapas_predict(pmap = test_probability_maps[[i]],
                                  model = tapas_model,
                                  clamp = TRUE,
                                  k = 0,
                                  verbose = TRUE)
}
```

The `tapas_predict_par` function simply is a parallel wrapper around `tapas_predict`. Before we look at the return objects from these functions let's replicate the results from `tapas_predict` using `tapas_predict_par` with 2 cores. The `tapas_predict_par` function is compatible with on both Unix and Windows machines. Again, the code below is going to run on 2 cores so be sure your machine has access to 2 cores or reduce back down to 1.

The inputs for `tapas_predict_par` are similar to the `tapas_predict` function but instead of single subject values include either a `list` of `nifti` objects or a `vector` of file paths to `nifti` objects. By setting `ret = TRUE` the TAPAS predicted subject data generated by the wrapped `tapas_predict` function will be returned locally as a `list`. This object may be extremely large depending on the number of subjects used for training so be aware of memory constraints if returning these objects locally. By default `outfile = NULL` and the predicted subject-level data generated will not be saved out. If users would like to save the predicted subject-level data out then users must specify a vector of file names with `.rda` or `.RData` file extensions included. Be sure that across `list` and `vector` inputs the subject-level information is sorted and consistent across each input.

```{r}
# Store results created on 2 cores
# Run tapas_predict_par function
test_data2 = tapas_predict_par(cores = 2, 
                               pmap = test_probability_maps, 
                               subject_id = test_ids, 
                               model = tapas_model, 
                               clamp = TRUE,
                               k = 0, 
                               ret = TRUE, 
                               outfile = NULL, 
                               verbose = TRUE)
```

The data produced using these functions is exactly the same. The only difference is whether users would like to utilize parallel computing. Below we show that the data produced for subject 11 is the same in both:

```{r}
all.equal(test_data1[[1]]$subject_threshold, test_data2[[1]]$subject_threshold)
all.equal(sum(test_data1[[1]]$tapas_binary_mask), sum(test_data2[[1]]$tapas_binary_mask))
all.equal(sum(test_data1[[1]]$group_binary_mask), sum(test_data2[[1]]$group_binary_mask))
```

The `tapas_predict` function returns a list containing the TAPAS predicted `subject_threshold`, the binary segmentation mask produced by applying the TAPAS predicted `subject_threshold` called `tapas_binary_mask`, and the binary segmentation mask produced by applying the group threshold `group_binary_mask`.

```{r}
names(test_data1[[1]])
```

# Evaluate Performance

Let's visualize and quantify the masks produced by the `tapas_predict` and `tapas_predict_par` functions. First we will look at the TAPAS produced binary segmentations.

```{r}
# The TAPAS binary masks
oro.nifti::image(test_data1[[1]]$tapas_binary_mask) + 
  oro.nifti::image(test_data1[[2]]$tapas_binary_mask) +
  oro.nifti::image(test_data1[[3]]$tapas_binary_mask) + 
  oro.nifti::image(test_data1[[4]]$tapas_binary_mask) +
  oro.nifti::image(test_data1[[5]]$tapas_binary_mask)
```

Now we will look at the group threshold produced binary segmentation masks.

```{r}
# The group threshold binary masks
oro.nifti::image(test_data1[[1]]$group_binary_mask) + 
  oro.nifti::image(test_data1[[2]]$group_binary_mask) +
  oro.nifti::image(test_data1[[3]]$group_binary_mask) + 
  oro.nifti::image(test_data1[[4]]$group_binary_mask) +
  oro.nifti::image(test_data1[[5]]$group_binary_mask)
```

With these masks we can calculate DSC to compare the TAPAS and group threshold masks.

```{r}
# Calculate DSC in each mask
dsc = tibble::tibble(
  tapas_dsc = c(aliviateR::dsc(test_gold_standard_masks[[1]], test_data1[[1]]$tapas_binary_mask),
                aliviateR::dsc(test_gold_standard_masks[[2]], test_data1[[2]]$tapas_binary_mask),
                aliviateR::dsc(test_gold_standard_masks[[3]], test_data1[[3]]$tapas_binary_mask),
                aliviateR::dsc(test_gold_standard_masks[[4]], test_data1[[4]]$tapas_binary_mask),
                aliviateR::dsc(test_gold_standard_masks[[5]], test_data1[[5]]$tapas_binary_mask)),
  group_dsc = c(aliviateR::dsc(test_gold_standard_masks[[1]], test_data1[[1]]$group_binary_mask),
                aliviateR::dsc(test_gold_standard_masks[[2]], test_data1[[2]]$group_binary_mask),
                aliviateR::dsc(test_gold_standard_masks[[3]], test_data1[[3]]$group_binary_mask),
                aliviateR::dsc(test_gold_standard_masks[[4]], test_data1[[4]]$group_binary_mask),
                aliviateR::dsc(test_gold_standard_masks[[5]], test_data1[[5]]$group_binary_mask)))
# Print DSC
dsc
```
